	abstract = {It is known that a number of algebraic properties of the braid groups extend to arbitrary finite Coxeter-type Artin groups. Here we show how to extend the results to more general groups that we call Garside groups. Define a Gaussian monoid to be a finitely generated cancellative monoid where the expressions of a given element have bounded lengths, and where left and right lowest common multiples exist. A Garside monoid is a Gaussian monoid in which the left and right lowest common multiples satisfy an additional symmetry condition. A Gaussian group is the group of fractions of a Gaussian monoid, and a Garside group is the group of fractions of a Garside monoid. Braid groups and, more generally, finite Coxeter-type Artin groups are Garside groups. We determine algorithmic criteria in terms of presentations for recognizing Gaussian and Garside monoids and groups, and exhibit infinite families of such groups. We describe simple algorithms that solve the word problem in a Gaussian group, show that these algorithms have a quadratic complexity if the group is a Garside group, and prove that Garside groups have quadratic isoperimetric inequalities. We construct normal forms for Gaussian groups, and prove that, in the case of a Garside group, the language of normal forms is regular, symmetric, and geodesic, has the 5-fellow traveller property, and has the uniqueness property. This shows in particular that Garside groups are geodesically fully biautomatic. Finally, we consider an automorphism of a finite Coxeter-type Artin group derived from an automorphism of its defining Coxeter graph, and prove that the subgroup of elements fixed by this automorphism is also a finite Coxeter-type Artin group that can be explicitly determined. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification: primary 20F05, 20F36; secondary 20B40, 20M05.},

Certain sufficient conditions for the algebra to be noetherian and {PI} are determined. For this, we prove more generally that right noetherian algebras of finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension defined by homogeneous semigroup relations satisfy a polynomial identity. The structure of the underlying monoid, defined by the same presentation, is described. This is used to derive information on the prime radical and minimal prime ideals. Some examples are described in detail. Earlier, Gateva-Ivanova and van den Bergh, and Jespers and Okniński considered special classes of such algebras in the contexts of noetherian algebras, Gröbner bases, finitely generated solvable groups, semigroup algebras, and set theoretic solutions of the {Y}ang-{B}axter equation.},

The family of Garside groups contains all Artin-Tits groups of spherical type. We show that the well-known notion of a parabolic subgroup of an Artin-Tits group can be extended to the framework of Garside groups so that most of the standard properties known in the Artin-Tits groups case are preserved. The extension is not trivial and it requires a new approach. We also define the more general notion of a Garside subgroup of a Garside group that nicely extends the notion of an {LCM}-homomorphism between Artin-Tits groups.},

We give several equivalent constructions: algebraically, the new monoid arises when studying Coxeter systems in a “dual” way, replacing the pair (W,S) by (W,T), with T the set of all reflections; geometrically, it arises when looking at the reflection arrangement from a certain basepoint. In the type A case, we recover the monoid constructed by Birman, Ko and Lee. Résumé Nous étudions une nouvelle structure de monoı̈de pour les groupes d'Artin associés aux systèmes de Coxeter finis. Ce nouveau monoı̈de est, tout comme le classique monoı̈ des tresses positives, un monoı̈de de Garside.

It is shown that the tree-like structure of such an iterated crossed product is equivalent to a partial cycle set, closely related to a class of set-theoretic solutions of the quantum {Y}ang-{B}axter equation. The decomposition of finite square-free solutions is related to the crossed product representation of the corresponding structure group.},

  abstract = {Let G be a Garside group with Garside element $\Delta$, and let $\Delta$m be the minimal positive central power of $\Delta$. An element g in G is said to be periodic if some power of it is a power of $\Delta$. In this paper, we study periodic elements in Garside groups and their conjugacy classes. We show that the periodicity of an element does not depend on the choice of a particular Garside structure if and only if the center of G is cyclic; if gk=Δka for some nonzero integer k, then g is conjugate to Δa; every finite subgroup of the quotient group G/〈Δm〉 is cyclic. By a classical theorem of Brouwer, Kerékjártó and Eilenberg, an n-braid is periodic if and only if it is conjugate to a power of one of two specific roots of Δ2. We generalize this to Garside groups by showing that every periodic element is conjugate to a power of a root of Δm. We introduce the notions of slimness and precentrality for periodic elements, and show that the super summit set of a slim, precentral periodic element is closed under any partial cycling. For the conjugacy problem, we may assume the slimness without loss of generality. For the Artin groups of type An, Bn, Dn, I2(e) and the braid group of the complex reflection group of type (e,e,n), endowed with the dual Garside structure, we may further assume the precentrality.},

Using techniques developed by Bestvina for Artin groups of finite type, we construct K($\pi$, 1)s for Garside groups. This construction shows that the (co)homology of any Garside group G is easily computed given the lattice {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}D{\}}{\$}{\$}, and there is a simple sufficient condition that implies G is a duality group. The universal covers of these K($\pi$, 1)s enjoy Bestvina's weak nonpositive curvature condition. Under a certain tameness condition, this implies that every solvable subgroup of G is virtually Abelian.},

This definition yields actions of the submonoids on each other, which we show to be structure preserving. We prove that K is a Garside monoid if and only if both of the submonoids are Garside monoids. In this case, these factors are parabolic submonoids of K and the Garside structure of K can be described in terms of the Garside structures of the factors. We give explicit isomorphisms between the lattice structures of K and the product of the lattice structures on the factors that respect the Garside normal forms. In particular, we obtain explicit natural bijections between the normal form language of K and the product of the normal form languages of its factors.},

In particular, they provided a criterion for decomposability of involutive solutions based on the transitivity of the structure group. In that paper, the diagonal permutation \\$T\\$ is also introduced. It is known that this permutation is trivial exactly when the solution is square free. Rump [ 12] proved that these solutions are decomposable except in the trivial case. Later, Ramirez and Vendramin [ 11] gave some criteria for decomposability related with the diagonal permutation \\$T\\$. In this paper it was proven that an involutive solution is decomposable when the number of symbols of the solution and the order of the diagonal permutation \\$T\\$ are coprime.}},

  abstract = {Indecomposable involutive non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions (X,r) of the Yang–Baxter equation of cardinality p1⋯pn, for different prime numbers p1,…,pn, are studied. It is proved that they are multipermutation solutions of level ≤n. In particular, there is no simple solution of a non-prime square-free cardinality. This solves a problem stated in [11] and provides a far reaching extension of several earlier results on indecomposability of solutions. The proofs are based on a detailed study of the brace structure on the permutation group G(X,r) associated to such a solution. It is proved that p1,…,pn are the only primes dividing the order of G(X,r). Moreover, the Sylow pi-subgroups of G(X,r) are elementary abelian pi-groups and if Pi denotes the Sylow pi-subgroup of the additive group of the left brace G(X,r), then there exists a permutation σ∈Symn such that Pσ(1),Pσ(1)Pσ(2),…, Pσ(1)Pσ(2)⋯Pσ(n) are ideals of the left brace G(X,r) and G(X,r)=P1P2⋯Pn. In addition, indecomposable solutions of cardinality p1⋯pn that are multipermutation of level n are constructed, for every nonnegative integer n.},

This solves a problem of Gateva-Ivanova in the case of abelian IYB groups. It also implies that the corresponding finitely presented abelian-by-finite groups (called the structure groups) are poly-Z groups. Secondly, an example of a solution with an abelian involutive {Y}ang-{B}axter group which is not a generalized twisted union is constructed. This answers in the negative another problem of Gateva-Ivanova. The constructed solution is of multipermutation level 3. Retractability of solutions is also proved in the case where the natural generators of the IYB group are cyclic permutations. Moreover, it is shown that such solutions are generalized twisted unions.},

It is known that the structure group G(X,r) of a finite multipermutation solution (X,r) is a poly-Z group, thus our result gives a rich source of examples of braided groups and left braces G(X,r) which are poly-Z groups but not Engel groups. We find an explicit relation between the multipermutation level of a left brace and the length of the radical chain A(n+1)=A(n)⁎A introduced by Rump. We also show that a finite solution of the {Y}ang-{B}axter equation can be embedded in a convenient way into a finite left brace, or equivalently into a finite involutive braided group.},

  abstract = {We show that, in an Artin–Tits group of spherical type, the intersection of two parabolic subgroups is a parabolic subgroup. Moreover, we show that the set of parabolic subgroups forms a lattice with respect to inclusion. This extends to all Artin–Tits groups of spherical type a result that was previously known for braid groups. To obtain the above results, we show that every element in an Artin–Tits group of spherical type admits a unique minimal parabolic subgroup containing it, which we call its parabolic closure. We also show that the parabolic closure of an element coincides with the parabolic closure of any of its powers or roots. As a consequence, if an element belongs to a parabolic subgroup, all its roots belong to the same parabolic subgroup. We define the simplicial complex of irreducible parabolic subgroups, and we propose it as the analogue, in Artin–Tits groups of spherical type, of the celebrated complex of curves which is an important tool in braid groups, and more generally in mapping class groups. We conjecture that the complex of irreducible parabolic subgroups is δ-hyperbolic.},
